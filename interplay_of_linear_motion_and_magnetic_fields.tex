\subsection{interplay of linear motion and magnetic fields}

In the previous sections we determined the local behavior of the system \eqref{eq:magnetichamiltonian2}, that is, outside the magnetic disks the particle travels along straight lines, and in the magnetic disks it travels along arc of circles. Respectively, on a torus, there is winding around the torus, and circular arcs. What is interesting to study now is the interplay of linear motion and deflection. Specifically, considered separately, the two modes of motion are easy to predict, meanwhile, when considered together: a particle leaving a magnetic disk may enter one of the neighboring ones, or given the right conditions, it can evade the disks for a ``long'' time.
