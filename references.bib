abstract = {In this paper we consider dynamical systems resulting from the motion of a material point in domains with strictly convex boundary, that is, such that the operator of the second quadratic form is negative-definite at each point of the boundary, where the boundary is taken to be equipped with the field of inward normals. We prove that such systems are ergodic and are K-systems. The basic method of investigation is the construction of transversal foliations for such systems and the study of their properties.}

  year={1976},

  volume={22},

  number={1},

  abstract={A new approach to the problem of evaluating the complexity ("randomness") of finite sequences is presented. The proposed complexity measure is related to the number of steps in a self-delimiting production process by which a given sequence is presumed to be generated. It is further related to the number of distinct substrings and the rate of their occurrence along the sequence. The derived properties of the proposed measure are discussed and motivated in conjunction with other well-established complexity criteria.},

abstract = {The problem of determining the circle of best fit to a set of points in the plane (or the obvious generalization ton-dimensions) is easily formulated as a nonlinear total least-squares problem which may be solved using a Gauss-Newton minimization algorithm. This straight-forward approach is shown to be inefficient and extremely sensitive to the presence of outliers. An alternative formulation allows the problem to be reduced to a linear least squares problem which is trivially solved. The recommended approach is shown to have the added advantage of being much less sensitive to outliers than the nonlinear least squares approach.},
